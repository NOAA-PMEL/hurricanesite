		<h1>NOAA's Saildrone Observations of Atlantic Hurricanes for Improved Intensity Forecasts</h1>
		<p>Improving the accuracy and ultimate value of NOAA's operational hurricane forecasts requires more complete real-time knowledge of atmospheric and oceanic conditions and more realistic representation of key physical processes in hurricane forecast models. To meet these needs, a research team from NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) are deploying <a href="https://www.saildrone.com/" target="_blank">saildrones</a> (see picture below) to observe conditions near the ocean surface during Atlantic hurricane seasons.</p>
		<p><img src="images/saildrone.png" alt="Saildrone on the water"/></p>
		<div class="image-caption">Saildrones are uncrewed surface vehicles powered by wind and solar energy and remotely piloted via satellite telecommunications. They measure solar irradiance, barometric pressure, air temperature, humidity, wind, waves, water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen, and ocean currents. They can also measure surface short- and long-wave radiation. The saildrones used in this project are specially designed for hurricane observations.</div>
		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<p>(1) Measure near-surface atmospheric and upper-ocean parameters to calculate energy and momentum fluxes between the atmosphere and ocean outside and within hurricanes.</p>
		<p>(2) Synchronize observations from saildrones, ocean gliders (see picture below), and air-deployed instruments and drones to measure the coupling between the atmosphere and upper ocean.</p>
		<p>(3) Transmit data in real-time to operational weather prediction centers to improve atmosphere-ocean initial conditions in forecast models.</p>
		<p>(4) Apply the observations to understand how air-sea interaction affects hurricane intensity and to advance hurricane prediction models.</p>

		<div class="image-caption"><a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hurricane-glider-project/" target="_blank">Ocean gliders</a> are uncrewed underwater vehicles powered by batteries. They measure water temperature, salinity, and currents from the surface down to 1000 m. They send their observations to satellites when they are at the ocean surface. There are usually approximately 20 glider missions operating during the hurricane season, several of them in areas where the saildrones collect observations, providing quasi-collocated simultaneous observations of the ocean and atmosphere.</div>
		<h2>Deployments</h2>
		<p>Saildrone observations typically cover the peak of the hurricane season (August 1-October 31). They are normally deployed to areas where the chances of hurricane occurrence are high. Observations are sent to worldwide weather prediction centers in real time to assist their operational forecasts. Data are <a href="https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/pmel/erddap/search/index.html?page=1&itemsPerPage=1000&searchFor=Saildrone+Hurricane+Monitoring+2021+NRT+data" target="_blank">publicly available</a>. This project also involves partnerships with NOAA's <a href="https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc_new.php" target="_blank">Environmental Modeling Center</a> (EMC) of the National Weather Service and the <a href="https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/index.html" target="_blank">CoastWatch</a> of NOAA's National Environmental Satellite and Data Information Service (NESDIS).</p>
		<h2>Highlights</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> One saildrone observed category-5 Hurricane Sam in September 2021. It took a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzgdSSb0T98" target="_blank">video</a> and measured surface heat fluxes and near-surface oceanic-atmospheric conditions near the hurricane's eyewall.</li>
			<li> During the 2021 mission, saildrones and ocean gliders were coordinated to take near-collocated, simultaneous measurement of the upper ocean and the surface ocean-atmosphere conditions.</li>
			<li> Atmospheric dropsondes and ocean probes were launched by NOAA and NASA research aircraft near the saildrones in 2021, providing additional observations to study interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. </li>
